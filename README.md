ExampleIntentServiceAndroid
The example is a App that created a Service using IntentService. 
This Service notify two kind of state; when the App start and finished the Service is started and completed. 
I also used a BroadcastNotifier class as manager operations on LocalBroadcastManager and BroadcastReceiver.
